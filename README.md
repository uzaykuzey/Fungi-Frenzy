**Description:**
Fungi Frenzy is a four-player computer game, designed around the theme of community expansion through growing mushrooms. The game is played on a 20x20 board, with each player starting at one of the four corners, each assigned a different color. It is a turn-based strategy game, where at the start of each turn players roll two dice to determine their step counts for that turn. Steps allow players to move and occupy tiles. The goal is to get the most tiles and dominate the board. Power-ups appear randomly on the board, providing tactical benefits such as extra steps and the ability to claim new tiles without moving.

**Why We Want to Make Such a Game:**
The game was conceived as a way to blend elements of strategy, fun and direct competition in a fun and exciting way. The game encourages critical thinking and planning, as players must balance expansion, power-ups and blocking their opponents to maintain control of the board, and win the game.

**Story/Theme of the Game:**
Set in an enchanted forest, fungi warriors are battling to spread their spores, to enlarge their territories aiming for the better future of their civilization. Four different fungus tribes are fighting for nutrients and space to grow. The game world serves as a metaphor for the competitive yet interconnected nature of ecosystems.
